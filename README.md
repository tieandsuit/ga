I'm going to talk about genetic algorithms ,  we will have a quick introduction to the different types of artificial intelligence, then I'll explain what are those genetic algorithms , what kind of problems they can be used for . Solving which kind of problems and finally I'll make a demo of XEL application that uses Brute force technique for solving a special kind of problem . So artificial intelligence is getting a lot of attention recently , why Is that so ?

Well we'll see but before that we have to see , we have to understand the different types of artificial intelligence . There's weak (AI) and strong (AI) so the typical example of artificial intelligence is chess do 20 years ago a computer was able to defeat the best human player of chess , Garry Kasparov being defeated and how did the program play chess well quite simple it computed all the possible moves of the next turn and the next turn and the next turn .. so that's a lot of different possible combinations but there's enough computer power for that there was enough like twenty years ago . And that's not really thinking that's not really intelligent . It's just brute force , so that's why it's called weak artificial intelligence . Because when you look and how it's done . It's just computing power, so every time we have a problem that we thought that required intelligence to solve it and we solve it by computation power using traditional algorithms . Well it's no longer considered to require intelligence and that's the limitation of weak artificial intelligence . If we don't care that the computer is thinking if it is intelligent or not  , but solve the problem that's good enough already .

But we have also strong artificial intelligence and in this case the the techniques are more complex are more advanced and it usually tries to imitate nature and the most typical example is neural networks where the program is going to model neurons and synapses , and then there is a real learning process where the neural network is exposed to some examples then it will learn from them and then when you present a problem that it hasn't seen before it's able to to respond from what it has learned before . So just two years ago , a computer using neural networks was able to defeat one of the best human players of goal which is a game that not as easy as chess  to win by brute force. Because the board is much bigger there's many more moves so it's impossible to have so much computation power as to win by just computing the all possible moves . So these neural network was exposed to human games to of Go and after it learned it was also they made it play against itself and he'd learned from itself and then that way it learned strategies which were never imagined by a human .  I was asking in the beginning why is it that artificial intelligence getting so much interest now by big companies . Well because in the past like ten years ago making a big neural network especially deep neural networks with many neuron layers making it learn was very hard . It took like months to make a neural network  , big one , learn them . Then some guys discovered that technique that made it easier just from month to days and also we have of course much more computing power now . For example we can use graphic accelerators for computing in parallel so that you can propagate the signal through the network etc .. so that's why we can do things now that we couldn't do ten years ago like very good image recognition or winning Go .
