I'm going to talk about genetic algorithms ,  we will have a quick introduction to the different types of artificial intelligence, then I'll explain what are those genetic algorithms , what kind of problems they can be used for . Solving which kind of problems and finally I'll make a demo of XEL application that uses Brute force technique for solving a special kind of problem . So artificial intelligence is getting a lot of attention recently , why Is that so ?

Well we'll see but before that we have to see , we have to understand the different types of artificial intelligence . There's weak (AI) and strong (AI) so the typical example of artificial intelligence is chess do 20 years ago a computer was able to defeat the best human player of chess , Garry Kasparov being defeated and how did the program play chess well quite simple it computed all the possible moves of the next turn and the next turn and the next turn .. so that's a lot of different possible combinations but there's enough computer power for that there was enough like twenty years ago . And that's not really thinking that's not really intelligent . It's just brute force , so that's why it's called weak artificial intelligence . Because when you look and how it's done . It's just computing power, so every time we have a problem that we thought that required intelligence to solve it and we solve it by computation power using traditional algorithms . Well it's no longer considered to require intelligence and that's the limitation of weak artificial intelligence . If we don't care that the computer is thinking if it is intelligent or not  , but solve the problem that's good enough already .
